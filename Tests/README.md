This section contains some preliminary tests on the pitch tracking algorithms currently implemented.

In the Test Sounds folder synthesized, as well as recorded test sounds are provided. For synthesized sounds an Audacity project is included.
In the Results folder results are organized based on the configuration file (provided) that generated them. Filename indicates what test sound was used for the test. The suffix AT indicates whether or not AutoTune was active for that particular file.
